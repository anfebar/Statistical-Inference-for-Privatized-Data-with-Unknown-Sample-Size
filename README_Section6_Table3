# Reproducing Results in Table 3 of Section 6.1

This README file provides instructions for using the files and running the code in the folder named `Section6.1`. These steps will help users reproduce the results associated with the Bootstrap approach reported in Table 3 of Section 6.1. The software used to generate the results is the R programming language.

## Steps to Reproduce the Results

1. **Set Working Directory**

   * Set the working directory to the folder named `Section6.1/Table3`.

2. **Install Required Libraries**

   * Ensure the following libraries are installed in R:

     ```r
     install.packages("VGAM")
     install.packages("MASS")
     install.packages("xtable")
     install.packages("matrixcalc")
     ```

3. **Run the Simulation Code**

   * Run the R script `linearregression_parametric_bootstrap.R`. This will execute all simulations for all scenarios and place the output files in the `outputs` folder.

     ```r
     source("linearregression_parametric_bootstrap.R")
     ```

4. **Analyze the Results**

   * Run the R script `Bootstrap_Processing.R` to analyze the results generated in step 3 and reproduce Table 3 in Section 6.1.

## Notes

   * By following these steps, the user should be able to reproduce the results reported in Table 3 of Section 6.1 using the provided R scripts.

   * To generate the output files in step 3, we used a desktop running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. The analysis was conducted using R version 4.4.3 (2025-02-28) and the following package versions:

packageVersion("VGAM")
# [1] ‘1.1.9’
packageVersion("MASS")
# [1] ‘7.3.65’
packageVersion("matrixcalc")
# [1] ‘1.0.6’

The machine uses an Intel(R) Xeon(R) W-2145 CPU @ 3.70GHz processor with 16 cores available for parallel computing. The user can modify the number of cores or replace mclapply with lapply if parallelization is not desired.
