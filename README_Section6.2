# Reproducing Results in Section 6.2

This README file provides instructions to use the files and run the code in the folder named `Section6.2`. These instructions will help users reproduce the results associated with the analysis of the ATUS dataset reported in Section 6.2. The software used to generate the results is the R programming language.

## Steps to Reproduce the Results

1. **Set Working Directory**
   - Set the working directory to the folder named `Section6.2`.

2. **Install Required Libraries**
   - Ensure that the following libraries are installed in R:
     ```r
     install.packages("coda")
     install.packages("LaplacesDemon")
     install.packages("Rcpp")
     install.packages("parallel")
     ```

3. **Run the Simulation Code**
   - Run the code available in the R script `ATUS_code.R`. This code will run all scenarios and place the output files in the folder named `output`.
     ```r
     source("ATUS_code.R")
     ```

4. **Analyze the Results**
   - Run the code available in the R script `Selected_plots.R` to analyze the results generated in step 3 and reproduce the results reported in Section 6.2.
     ```r
     source("Selected_plots.R")
     ```
     This script will create a PDF file containing all the figures associated with Section 6.2.

## Notes

- To generate the output files in step 3, we used parallel computing using the `mclapply` function from the `parallel` library. If the user does not want to use this function, it can be replaced by the `lapply` function. 

- The code was run using a desktop running Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS with the following specifications:
  - RAM: 62GB
  - CPU(s): 16
  - Model name: Intel(R) Xeon(R) W-2145 CPU @ 3.70GHz

- The following library versions were used:
     ```r
     packageVersion("coda")
     # [1] ‘0.19.4’
     packageVersion("LaplacesDemon")
     # [1] ‘16.1.6’
     packageVersion("Rcpp")
     # [1] ‘1.0.8’
     packageVersion("parallel")
     # [1] ‘4.3.3’
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to reproduce the results reported in Section 6.2 using the provided R scripts.
